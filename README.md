# figma2web
Conversion of fixed sized Figma template to responsive HTML web page.

For local changes the file index.html can be edited from any directory as it doesn't require any web server or language processors (like PHP). However, to publish the page live, all files within this folder should be uploaded to the public_html or htdocs folder within the webserver. 

All files required for the webpage to work are contained within this single folder.

Number of HTML files: 1 (index.html)
Number of Images: 8 (diversity_icon.webp, groups_icon.webp, wealth_icon.webp, left_arrow.webp, right_arrow.webp, one.webp, two.webp, three.webp)

LIVE PREVIEW can be seen at https://data.designmaze.net/repo/ (will remain there for a limited time though)



NOTE: Slides can be added/deleted/modified on the News Section of webpage by editing the JSON object in the index.html page. Right now 3 more slides have been added by us as an example, they use same images as first 3 slides for now. Please don't forget to add an image within the main folder before adding a new slide in the JSON array.
